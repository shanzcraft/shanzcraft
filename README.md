# Hello!

I'm Shannon, a junior software developer specializing in game and web development.

## Main Tools & technologies that I'm using right now
- JavaScript
- HTML & CSS
- GDScript (Godot)
- C# (Unity 2D & 3D)
- Twine

## What I’m working on at the moment
- Developing games and interactive experiences in Godot, Unity, and with Node.js and Electron
- Building modern, responsive web projects
- Expanding my GitHub portfolio
